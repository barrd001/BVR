          For thousands of years, millions of herbivores migrated across the
          grasslands of the earth, spurred on by packs of predators who followed
          them. These creatures cut down the grasses and weeds as they fed as
          well as crushing and grinding the leftovers into the ground under
          their tremendous weight while fertilizing with their droppings. This
          simple act of nature fed the earthworms, fungi, and other organisms
          and created some of the most fertile soils on Earth.

          Today we strive to mimic nature with holistically managed, pastured
          miniature cattle, poultry, and no till farming to improve our soils
          and in an effort to reverse desertification.
